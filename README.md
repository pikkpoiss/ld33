"You are the Monster"

## Ideas

 - General
   - Sol-style: build something up and have to sacrifice it at the end

 - Zelda-esque
   - Eating people makes you grow in size and power
   - Go through level, fight a boss at the end
   - Number of people eaten determines power against boss
 - Rhythm
   - Monster under bed
   - Have to scare child to a beat
   - Pop out when a parent is there and lose
 - Puzzle
   - Floorplan of house
   - Scare children to move them into other rooms
   - When a child is in a room something unlocks
 - Monster simcity
   - People walk through a house
   - Build things to scare them (get currency)
   - If too scary they die and have heart attack
   - Goal is to optimize fear / person
   - Adding things changes paths, can wind up having bad consequences
 - Rampage
